# From Sensor to Graph

---

## DHT22

![left](dht22.jpg)

- Sensor with both temperature and humidty
- Three pins to connect to arduino
  - power - ground - data

---

## ESP8266

- Wemos D1 mini
- Inbuilt WiFi
- 80MHz chip

---

## ESP32

![right](d32.jpg)

- D32
- Inbuilt WiFi
- Bluetooth
- 160MHz chip
- + lots more

---

## Raspberry PI

- Rasbperry Pi 3B+

---

## MQTT

- Simple publish/subscribe server designed for IoT usage
- Publish bytes of data to a topic
- Subscribe to the topic and get sent bytes of data

---

## Arduino coding

Basically C++ with some extras

---

### DHT22

```c++
dht DHT;

DHT.read22(D1);

float temperature = DHT.temperature;
float humidity = DHT.humidity;
```

---

### MQTT

```c++
// Create and configure
PubSubClient client(wifiClient);
client.setServer(MQTT_SERVER, 1883);

// Connect
client.connect(CLIENT_NAME, MQTT_USER, MQTT_PASSWORD);

// Publish
client.publish(MQTT_TOPIC, message);
```
