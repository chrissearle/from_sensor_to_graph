## DHT22

![left](dht22.jpg)

- Sensor with both temperature and humidty
- Three pins to connect to arduino
  - power - ground - data

---

## Arduino

- Arduino
- ESP8266/ESP32

---

## MQTT

- Simple publish/subscribe server designed for IoT usage
- Publish bytes of data to a topic
- Subscribe to the topic and get sent bytes of data

---

## Arduino coding

Arduino is basically C++ with some extras

---

### DHT22

```c++
// Add sensor on arduino pin D1
DHT dht(D1, DHT22);

float temperature = dht.readTemperature();
float humidity = dht.readHumidity();
```

---

### MQTT

```c++
// Create and configure
PubSubClient client(wifiClient);
client.setServer(MQTT_SERVER, 1883);

// Connect
client.connect(CLIENT_NAME, MQTT_USER, MQTT_PASSWORD);

// Publish
client.publish(MQTT_TOPIC, message);
```
